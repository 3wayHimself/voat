        <h1>What is WhoaVerse partner program?</h1>
        <p>We believe that community behind any successful service is the main reason why a service is succesful.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, companies that run services with large communities rarely award the people that helped build said communities. In fact, they often do the opposite - they sell out and turn the community into a money-making machine with no regard for privacy of the very users that built said community.</p>
        <p>
            We plan to change all that. We want to not only give WhoaVerse company shares to our users, but we also want to try something completely new which we believe was never done before:
            <b>we want to share a fair portion of our ad revenue with the very users who share their original content, the people who write comments and the moderators who keep everything spam free</b>.
        </p>
        <h1>How will you reward users?</h1>
        <p>We are still working out the details of this process and we are open for suggestions. So far the following is being discussed:</p>
        <p>- An option to reward users with a portion of WhoaVerse ad-revenue earnings based on the quality of the content they submit to WhoaVerse</p>
        <p>- An option to let users donate their earnings to humanitarian causes</p>
        <p>- An option to let users gift their earnings to other WhoaVerse users</p>
        <h1>Why reward users?</h1>
        <p>By rewarding content creators, we hope to promote creation of original content. By rewarding people who take their time to write comments and vote, we want to encourage quality of said comments.</p>
        <h1>Won't paying users encourage spam?</h1>
        <p>On the contrary. Criteria for what the term "quality content" is still being discussed, but there will be a strict process and zero tolerance for spam. Only content which community enjoys will be subject for reward.</p>
        <h1>What about payment methods?</h1>
        <p>We plan to use digital currency for easy payments of earnings to users and content creators, but traditional payment methods will also be available.</p>
        <h1>Where do I sign up?</h1>
        <p>We thought you'd never ask! Our partnership program is still being developed, but you can <a href="/p/apply">go here to sign up</a> and express your interest in the program. We will contact you with further details once we are ready for launch.</p>
        <p>If you want to openly discuss our partnership program and submit your ideas or concerns, please start a new discussion in <a href="/v/ideasforwhoaverse">/v/ideasforwhoaverse</a>.</p>
